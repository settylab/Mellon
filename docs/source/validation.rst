Validation
==========

The `validation` module provides a set of functions used internally to validate
and format inputs throughout `mellon`. These functions ensure that data meets
the required standards and formats, promoting consistency and reliability within
the package. They are made accessible here to assist developers in implementing
custom features in `mellon`, such as those within a Jupyter notebook.
