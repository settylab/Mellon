"""
Why this file exists:
=====================
In the Mellon library, the compute_ls_time module deserves its own file due to its
complexity and size. However, it's also a part of the parameters submodule and it
imports the DensityEstimator, which leads to a potential circular import issue if
we tried to import from the paremeters submodule into the DensityEstimator module.

This file, all_parameters.py, is a workaround to avoid this circular import problem.
It gathers all the necessary functions from the parameters submodule, including
compute_ls_time, and makes them available for import as a package in the __init__.py
file.

Hence, when the DensityEstimator module needs to use the functions defined in
parameters.py, it can does not import itselfe.
